# üéóÔ∏è Breast Cancer Diagnosis with Neural Networks 

This project uses a neural network to predict whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on diagnostic features extracted from medical imaging. 
---

## Project Workflow

### Importing Libraries  
Essential Python packages for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

### Data Exploration  
Initial inspection using `.head()`, `.info()`, `.isnull()`, and `.describe()` to understand the structure, completeness, and basic statistics of the dataset.

### Data Analysis  
Visual storytelling through pair plots, box plots, pie charts, and heatmaps to uncover feature relationships, class distribution, and potential outliers.

### Data Transformation  
Preparing the data for modeling by encoding categorical variables and applying **StandardScaler** to normalize feature values.

### Modeling  
Building and training a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras to classify tumors based on the transformed features.

### Model Evaluation & Visualization  
Evaluating performance using `model.evaluate()` to report test loss and accuracy. Visual insights include:
- Loss Over Epochs  
- Accuracy Over Epochs  
- Prediction Confidence Distribution
